# Introduction

This project was 'forked' from a CVS repository over on SourceForge at:
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/java-ntlm-proxy/> where it had a license of 'Public Domain'.

I use this a fair bit at work and it has a couple of bugs and other areas for improvements. So first
step was to get to where I can easily access the code and work on.

In the migration, I did only bring across the main directory which has the source - there was some
other directories. Since then, I have also removed a couple of other directories.
